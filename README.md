This module provides Haskell binding for Eigen.
Eigen is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
Eigen home page is <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/>.

Eigen is licensed under the MPL2, which is a simple weak copyleft license. Common questions about the MPL2 are answered in the official [MPL2 FAQ].

Note that currently, a few features in Eigen rely on third-party code licensed under the LGPL: SimplicialCholesky, AMD ordering, and constrained\_cg. Such features are explicitly disabled by compiling Eigen with the EIGEN\_MPL2\_ONLY preprocessor symbol defined.

Virtually any software may use Eigen. For example, closed-source software may use Eigen without having to disclose its own source code. Many proprietary and closed-source software projects are using Eigen right now, as well as many BSD-licensed projects.
